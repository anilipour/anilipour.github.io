I am a junior undergraduate at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/) majoring in [Astrophysics](https://astronomy.yale.edu/) and [Mathematics](https://math.yale.edu/), with a certificate in [Japanese](https://eall.yale.edu/). I am broadly interested in [cosmology](/cosmology), [radio astronomy](/radio_astronomy), and [SETI](/seti), and I am currently doing [research](/research) on using neural networks to estimate the linear point of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations feature, measuring properties and kinematics of clouds feeding the Central Molecular Zone, and classifying simulated LSST light curves. I was a 2022 Breakthrough Listen intern at the [UC Berkeley SETI Research Center](https://seti.berkeley.edu/listen/) and am currently a [National Radio Astronomy Observatory](https://public.nrao.edu/) intern in Socorro, NM. 

This coming fall, I will begin a ten month study abroad program at [International Christian University](https://www.icu.ac.jp/en/) in Mitaka, Tokyo, Japan, where I will focus on language study. As part of the curriculum, I will also participate in an internship at the [National Astronomical Observatory of Japan](https://www.nao.ac.jp/en/).

Outside of academics, I enjoy [watching movies](https://letterboxd.com/anilipour/) and [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/35239876-andy?shelf=read).
