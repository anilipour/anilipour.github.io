I am a rising senior undergraduate at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/) majoring in [Astrophysics](https://astronomy.yale.edu/) and [Mathematics](https://math.yale.edu/), with a certificate in [Japanese](https://eall.yale.edu/). I am broadly interested in [cosmology](/cosmology), [radio astronomy](/radioastronomy), and [SETI](/seti), and I am doing [research](/research) on developing regularized maximum likelihood algorithms for Event Horizon Telescope data, using neural networks to estimate the linear point of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations feature, measuring properties and kinematics of molecular clouds in the Milky Way bar region, and classifying simulated LSST light curves. I was a 2022 NSF Breakthrough Listen intern at the [UC Berkeley SETI Research Center](https://seti.berkeley.edu/listen/) and a 2023 NSF [National Radio Astronomy Observatory](https://public.nrao.edu/) intern in Socorro, NM. I took a leave of absence from Yale for the 2023-24 school year and studyied abroad at [International Christian University](https://www.icu.ac.jp/en/) in Mitaka, Tokyo, Japan, focusing on language study, and was an intern in the [National Astronomical Observatory of Japan](https://www.nao.ac.jp/en/) Mizusawa VLBI group. I am a member of the [Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/) and am currently at the [MIT Haystack Observatory](https://www.haystack.mit.edu/) for the summer of 2024.



Outside of academics, I enjoy [watching movies](https://letterboxd.com/anilipour/) and [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/35239876-andy?shelf=read).
