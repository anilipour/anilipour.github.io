I am a junior undergraduate at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/) majoring in [Astrophysics](https://astronomy.yale.edu/) and [Mathematics](https://math.yale.edu/), with a certificate in [Japanese](https://eall.yale.edu/). I am broadly interested in [cosmology](/cosmology), [radio astronomy](/radio_astronomy), and [SETI](/seti), and I am doing [research](/research) on developing regularized maximum likelihood algorithms for Event Horizon Telescope data, using neural networks to estimate the linear point of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations feature, measuring properties and kinematics of clouds feeding the Central Molecular Zone, and classifying simulated LSST light curves. I was a 2022 Breakthrough Listen intern at the [UC Berkeley SETI Research Center](https://seti.berkeley.edu/listen/) and a 2023 [National Radio Astronomy Observatory](https://public.nrao.edu/) intern in Socorro, NM, and am a member of the [Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/).

I am currently on a leave of absence from Yale and studying abroad at [International Christian University](https://www.icu.ac.jp/en/) in Mitaka, Tokyo, Japan, focusing on language study. As part of the curriculum, I am also participating in an internship at the [National Astronomical Observatory of Japan](https://www.nao.ac.jp/en/).

Outside of academics, I enjoy [watching movies](https://letterboxd.com/anilipour/) and [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/35239876-andy?shelf=read).
