I am a [Churchill Scholar](https://www.churchillscholarship.org/) at the Cavendish Laboratory, [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), where I am pursuing a Master's degree in [Physics](https://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/). My [research](/research) interests lie broadly in data-driven approaches to [cosmology](/cosmology) and [radio astronomy](/radioastronomy).

I graduated from [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/), where I studied [Astrophysics](https://astronomy.yale.edu/), [Mathematics](https://math.yale.edu/), and [Japanese](https://eall.yale.edu/), and received the [Russell Henry Chittenden Prize](https://news.yale.edu/2025/05/18/distinguished-seniors-recognized-yale-colleges-top-prizes). I was a 2022 NSF Breakthrough Listen intern at the [UC Berkeley SETI Research Center](https://seti.berkeley.edu/listen/) and a 2023 NSF [National Radio Astronomy Observatory](https://public.nrao.edu/) intern in Socorro, NM. I studied abroad at [International Christian University](https://www.icu.ac.jp/en/) in Mitaka, Tokyo, Japan during the 2023-24 school year and was an intern in the [National Astronomical Observatory of Japan](https://www.nao.ac.jp/en/) Mizusawa VLBI group. I am a member of the [Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/) and was at the [MIT Haystack Observatory](https://www.haystack.mit.edu/) for the summer of 2024. Outside of reearch, I enjoy [watching movies](https://letterboxd.com/anilipour/) and [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/35239876-andy?shelf=read).

Starting in the fall of 2026, I will be at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) for a PhD in [Astronomy](https://astronomy.fas.harvard.edu/).
