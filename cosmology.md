My primary research projects at Yale since 2020 have been in cosmology, advised by Nikhil Padmanabhan. 

### Linear Point Scale Estimation with Neural Networks

I am currently working with Farnik Nikakhtar and Nikhil Padmanabhan on estimating the linear point, the halfway point between the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) dip and peak features in the two-point correlation function, using neural networks. More information can be found in my [iPoster](https://aas242-aas.ipostersessions.com/Default.aspx?s=86-D2-09-E0-43-0F-A3-67-17-B4-3D-E5-79-17-B4-C2) presented at AAS 242 in Albuquerque.

### Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest 1D Power Spectrum Estimation

I previously worked with Naim Goksel-Karacayli and Nikhil Padmanabhan on estimating the 1D Ly-$\alpha$ forest power spectrum using the quadratic maximum likelihood estimator with data from the BOSS and eBOSS missions of SDSS. More information can be found in my [iPoster](https://aas240-aas.ipostersessions.com/?s=7A-34-77-02-25-72-22-5C-15-06-27-65-0D-E9-5E-D2) presented at AAS 240 in Pasadena.
