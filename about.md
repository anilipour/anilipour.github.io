I was born and raised in San Diego, but am currently a junior undergraduate at Yale University studying Astrophysics, Mathematics, and Japanese. In the fall, I will begin a ten month study abroad program at International Christian University in Tokyo. My primary research interests include SETI, radio astronomy, and cosmology. Outside of research and coursework, I enjoy hiking, watching movies, and East Asian literature.
