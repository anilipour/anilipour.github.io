My interest in radio astronomy stems from coursework, and I have had exciting opportunities to explore that interest in a research setting. Below are my current and future projects in the field.

### Feeding the Center of the Milky Way

I am currently a summer REU student at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Socorro, NM, where I am working with Juergen Ott (NRAO), Brian Svoboda (NRAO), and David Meier (NMT) on determining the kinematics of molecular clouds potentially feeding the Central Molecular Zone using observations with ALMA. 

More to come!

### Movies with the Event Horizon Telescope

In the fall, I will begin an internship at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, where I will work with Mareki Honma (NAOJ), Shiro Ikeda (ISM), and Kazunori Akiyama (MIT) on reconstructing movies from EHT data.

More to come!
