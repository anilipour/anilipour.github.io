My interest in radio astronomy stems from coursework, and I have had exciting opportunities to explore that interest in a research setting. Below are my current projects in the field.

### Movies with the Event Horizon Telescope

I am currently interning at the [National Astronomical Observatory of Japan](https://www.nao.ac.jp/en/), where I am working with [Kazunori Akiyama](https://kazuakiyama.github.io/) (MIT), [Shiro Ikeda](https://www.ikeda.cc/en/) (ISM), and Mareki Honma (NAOJ), on developing a new Julia-based software suite of regularized maximum likelihood (RML) techniques for EHT image reconstruction, as well as exploring RML EHT movie reconstruction with optimal transport distances as a regularizer.

### Feeding the Center of the Milky Way

I was a summer 2023 REU student at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Socorro, NM, where I worked with [Juergen Ott](https://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~jott/Welcome.html) (NRAO), [Brian Svoboda](https://autocorr.github.io/index.html) (NRAO), and [David Meier](http://kestrel.nmt.edu/~dmeier/) (NMT) on determining the kinematics of molecular clouds in the Milky Way Galactic bar region using ALMA observations. My final report is available [here](https://www.nrao.edu/students/2023/Reports/NilipourAndy.pdf). We are currently drafting a paper describing our results.
